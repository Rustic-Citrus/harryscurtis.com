If you've clicked on this post, you're probably familiar with AncestryDNA as it is. For those of you that are not familiar, AncestryDNA is, to state the obvious, a DNA test. Ancestry sends you a tube, you spit in it, and send it off to their labs. A few weeks later, they update your Ancestry account with an analysis of your DNA. However, it isn't as simple as that.

There are different sorts of DNA tests, and some reveal more information than others. The AncestryDNA test isn't meant to test your genetic predisposition for certain diseases. Instead, it tests a small segment of your DNA against a large sample of the global population. This allows Ancestry to find other users who have done also done the AncestryDNA test and have a genetic overlap with you (i.e., users who are related to you).
