## The User Experience

When you visit `r/deno`, you find a lot of users sharing their love for the project.

Deno saves you time at project initialisation. In most Node projects, there are a handful of modules developers often import and tools they install; e.g. _express_, _jest_ and _prettier_. Deno simplifies this. It adds the features by default; e.g. `deno test` is the native tester, there's no need to choose and install another testing framework.

Saving your users time, the developers building with your tools, is simply good design. As I used Node over the past few years, I found myself getting tireder of the repetitive steps for setup. Setting up Node is like starting an airplane. So many switches to be flicked, and lights to be checked. You find yourself asking, "When do I get to fly?" On the other hand, setting up Deno is like riding a bike. You get on it, and you start pedalling.

At the heart of it, developers want to create. Deno is becoming more popular precisely because it minimises the time that developers need to spend on preparing their tools, and maximises the time spent on creative work. That is the essence of good design.
